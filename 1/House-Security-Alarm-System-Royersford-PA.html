<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular since the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
