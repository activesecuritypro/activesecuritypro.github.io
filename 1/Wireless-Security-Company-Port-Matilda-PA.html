<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
