During our hands-on screening of Brinks, we found the systems to be somewhat easy to establish and use-- but not quite as simple as brands like SimpliSafe or Ring Alarm. Get home security and clever home automation without all the agreements and monthly costs.</p>
<p>Know the company's items. Certain kinds of equipment are common throughout home security systems, such as cameras and sensing units. Other products vary in performance from one company to another.

Also, Cove currently ships equipment with a Yi camera but doesn't incorporate it or any other cameras into the actual system.</p>
<p>While the wireless home security systems are an excellent choice, you need to consider what's right for you and your home.
