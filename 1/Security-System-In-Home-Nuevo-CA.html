<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical considering that the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients realize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
