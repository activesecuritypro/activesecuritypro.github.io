<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids speaking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly common.

With an expertly monitored system, the property owner will be called by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. False alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a property owner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>
