<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
