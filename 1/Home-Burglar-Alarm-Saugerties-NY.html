<p>A tight wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to identify any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to overlook objects that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
