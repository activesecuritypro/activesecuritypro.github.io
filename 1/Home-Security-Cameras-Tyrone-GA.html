<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false complacency because it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
