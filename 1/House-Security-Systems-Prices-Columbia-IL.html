<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents consulting with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively typical. If a house owner forgets their secrets and goes back within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is triggered by a community feline, it can set off the alarm.
