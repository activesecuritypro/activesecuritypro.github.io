<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents consulting with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively typical. If a house owner forgets their secrets and goes back within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is triggered by a community feline, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it rapidly. False alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a property owner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>
