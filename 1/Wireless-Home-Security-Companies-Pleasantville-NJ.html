<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered a data breach, but we concur with its recommendation that users should reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a preventive procedure. All smart-home gadgets are vulnerable to such events. However, after this latest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have decided to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it comes to video items, we do not believe that these issues modify the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our present suggestion.</p>
