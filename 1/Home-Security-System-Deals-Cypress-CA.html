<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
