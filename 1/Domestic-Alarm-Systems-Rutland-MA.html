<p>For these separate systems to assemble or to incorporate them together into a single user interface, a comprehensive knowledge of all the required systems is necessary. If there are no as-built files providing functionality and setup details to make this integration work, there are only two choices. The very first option, which might be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original solution provider is not available or unwilling to offer those information) and document the topology and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system.
