Once again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not discuss the 3 year commitment.

I'm paying the lump sum, because apparently they auto restore you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send out in a written not by mail.

<p>With an analog system, coaxial cable is needed for transmitting video footage from the CCTV security cameras. This is among the drawbacks of analog CCTV video surveillance, as the cable can be challenging and expensive to install, especially for bigger camera networks, and those were cameras should be positioned in challenging locations. When customers acquire among ADT's security packages, the company sends an authorized service technician with an average of 11 years experience to assess the home and install the equipment. In some cases, the company is able to supply expert installation services the exact same day.</p>
<p>We attempted each of the cameras in multiple locations around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we checked each camera using an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) in addition to an Android mobile phone (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie).
