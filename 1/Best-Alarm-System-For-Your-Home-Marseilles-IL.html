<p>There is a new pattern in surveillance video search innovation that is quickly altering the security industry, and it is called Deep Learning". What is Deep Knowing and why is it so essential?  For starters, Deep Knowing permits somebody to find what they are searching for without needing to search through hours of ineffective video footage.  Imagine a web page that works a lot like a Google search, where you can explain the elements you are searching for in the tape-recorded video footage.  For instance, if we need to see all video from today that has a patrol car in it, we just type cops" into the search window and in seconds every key frame of video with a police car appears.

<p>It deals with a wire or without, with a Canary Smart base station or without, and can run indoors or inside your home - you get a great deal of flexibility from this little device.

It costs a lot, its rates isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to point out that the customer support experience varies commonly depending upon the dealership you opt for. </p>
