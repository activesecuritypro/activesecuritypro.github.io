Because it uses infrared sensors and mass detection to distinguish between individuals and other inanimate things or smaller living things, it just gets triggered when a human comes in close proximity. If your motion sensing unit is triggered, you get an alert in your smart device app. There's no latency so you get alerted right away so you can take immediate actions such as setting off a loud alarm, getting in touch with the authorities, or utilizing the camera's two-way audio system to talk with the possible trespassers.</p>
