We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
