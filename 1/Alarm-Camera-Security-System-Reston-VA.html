<p>The Canary Flex features an intelligent variation that sends out signals directly to your phone if you're looking for motion detection. This camera provides a variety of features consisting of a 360-degree rotating base. Last time I reviewed a Swann camera I explained it as distinctly middle of the road.

This more recent version is much the same, to be frank.</p>
<p>The SimpliSafe equipment is now in its third variation, with an easier and more stylish design for both app and devices.
