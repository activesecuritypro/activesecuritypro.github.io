It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare individuals and basic motion.
