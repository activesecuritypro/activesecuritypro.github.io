For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a concern but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal.

And while this is a pretty standard feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is fairly unusual in outdoor security cameras.</p>
