Commercial homes tend to have even higher incorrect alarm rates than homes because more people tend to share obligation for triggering and shutting down the alarm, and the systems tend to be more intricate. The rate of false alarms for commercial alarm users might be as much as three times higher than the rate of false alarms amongst residential alarm users. 9 Persistent false alarm activations are typically due to insufficient staff member training or inferior systems that have not been updated.</p>
