<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it provides protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false complacency because it avoids only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
