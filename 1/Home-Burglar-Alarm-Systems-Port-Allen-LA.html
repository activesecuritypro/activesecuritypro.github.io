<p>Despite having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its limited, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug. (You can protect that plug and include another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension kit, or purchase a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This implies the Circle 2 winds up being more expensive overall per unit than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not suggest it since its battery-saving regimens can interrupt efficiency.</p>
