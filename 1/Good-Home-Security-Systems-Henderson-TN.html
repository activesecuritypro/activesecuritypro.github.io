<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered an information breach, but we concur with its suggestion that users need to reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a precautionary procedure. All smart-home devices are susceptible to such incidents.

While our company believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it concerns video items, we do not believe that these concerns change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our present recommendation.</p>
