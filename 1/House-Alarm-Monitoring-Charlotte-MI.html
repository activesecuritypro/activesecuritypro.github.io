Just like other DVRs it supports a cloud service that lets you from another location log in utilizing a mobile phone or tablet to view and record camera video footage in real-time.</p>
<p>The huge benefit is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a device that doesn't look like a home security system. You can set the alarm off or contact emergency situation services direct from the app if you see a disruption, and it rarely sends out incorrect signals because it tracks your phone (and other relative's phones), so comprehends when you're at home and turns everything off. Likewise, it will arm itself immediately when everyone has left.</p>
