The very first job is the alert of a siren, this enables everyone in your community including the property owners or company owner to know that an intruder has actually been spotted.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally regular given that the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers recognize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
