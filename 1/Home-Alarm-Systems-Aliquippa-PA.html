<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally regular given that the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers recognize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
