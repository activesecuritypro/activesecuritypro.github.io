<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you want to get out of the contract you have to pay 75% of the agreement.  So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no idea I was in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Truly frustrating. Again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not point out the 3 year dedication. I called their customer care team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to discuss it, it's on you to read the fine print. I'm paying the lump sum, because apparently they automobile renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send in a composed not by mail.
