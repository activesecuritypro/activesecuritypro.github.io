<p>We still believe the Ring Alarm is an excellent alternative for a cheap home security system with wise home assistance. But perhaps avoid the cameras for now. No matter what type or size of business you have, Slomin's provides heating equipment and services for your company. The primary difference is the way the signal is sent out Analogue systems turn the signal into a format a Video recorder or television screen can get. The IP camera digitises the signal and sends it out via packages over a network connection.</p>
<p>These cameras do not need a video capture card due to the fact that they work using a digital signal which can be conserved straight to a computer system. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be accomplished with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a somewhat lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be used up versus the quality of picture needed or desired). The highest picture quality of DVD is just a little lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
