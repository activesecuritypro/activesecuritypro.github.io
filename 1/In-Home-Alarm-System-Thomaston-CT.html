<h3>Which Burglar Alarm System in Thomaston CT</h3>

<h3>Home Security System Review in Connecticut</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never matches the manufacturer's stats because this comes from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the most significant offender for short battery life by far.

While wireless home security systems are popular and understood for an easier, more structured installation, hardwired systems are more trustworthy due to the fact that they aren't subject to disturbance.</p>
