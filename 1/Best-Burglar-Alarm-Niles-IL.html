We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare individuals and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>

<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the exact same area and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually installed on the deck by a certified electrical expert (who occurs to be my husband). All of the cameras were linked to the same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router inside your home (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
