<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>

We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
