<p>We have all heard that old stating, you get what you spend for". According to a report released by the Urban Institute, police departments across the country react to millions of incorrect alarms from person and business security systems every year. This costs towns and cities millions of dollars in wasted police resources. The Vivint Smart Home security system is simple and dependable to use, but expensive and eccentric unless you desire the benefit of a pro install and upkeep.</p>

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features.
