As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely typical given that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as clients recognize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
