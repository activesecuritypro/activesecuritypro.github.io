<p>To assess reaction times for the monitoring company, we triggered each system a minimum of 5 times, using contact and motion sensing units. However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls should be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs verification from a personal security guard. A number of cities also need a permit to even own and run a home security system.

We should keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the image quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that may beat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
