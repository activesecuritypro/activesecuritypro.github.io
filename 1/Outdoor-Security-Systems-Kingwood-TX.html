Over my 25 plus year career in the security market, I have investigated, sold, set up, and due to the fact that we have our own central station at American Alarm Systems, viewed alarm signals for more hours than I would like to admit.</p>
<p>When selecting a home security camera is whether you need an outdoor or indoor camera, the other significant choice. Outdoor cameras will typically be constructed to be more durable and able to make it through rain, frost, or damp.
