<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to disregard objects that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
