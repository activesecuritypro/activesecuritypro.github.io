Alarm associations recommend that false burglar alarms are not uniformly dispersed: some alarm experience no false alarms, and others, many.

The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after almost 2 years of day, night and use images have constantly been clear, and we never had problems with the camera missing motion, a problem we experienced when testing the Wyze Cam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a smart feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion identified. We've seen it highlight mice, vehicles, and moths.</p>

<h3>New House Alarm System Lawrence NY 11559</h3>
<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We initially discovered Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it rapidly ended up being a staff (and friends and family) favorite. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send out alerts, you can't manage it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
