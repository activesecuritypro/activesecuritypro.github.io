<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send smartphone alerts with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
