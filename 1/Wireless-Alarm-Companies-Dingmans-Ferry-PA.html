<p>Signed up for service for my Simon XTi and was active with their service an hour later on. The company that installed my alarm failed so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company. These individuals are $18 a month cheaper and stayed in business three decades so I'm comfortable giving them a shot.

<p>Frontpoint provides five packages and two monitoring plans: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester went with the Interactive plan but ended up dissatisfied with its lack of live video surveillance. When she received an alarm notification while on holiday, she had no way of determining whether her home had actually been burglarized or if her cat had actually managed to trip the sensing unit. It ended up being a false alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>

<p>Vivint's monitoring costs remain in line with our other top security companies, which is impressive given the sophisticated proprietary equipment and services that come with a Vivint home security system.
