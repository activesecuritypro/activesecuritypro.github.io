<p>CCTV cameras are positioned in locations where they are thought to be most efficient, which generally includes highly inhabited towns, city centers, car parks, or different other high-crime locations (Welsh and Farrington 2008).

In numerous cases, Geographic Information Systems innovation is used to specifically assess crime patterns for camera positioning; however, the positioning of cameras can also be the result of input from policeman and other criminal justice stakeholders (La Vigne et al. 2011).</p>

<h3>Security Alarm Equipment Maysville KY 41056</h3>
