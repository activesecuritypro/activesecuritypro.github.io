Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just a false complacency given that it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>

'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Big sibling? The Corporates? Or bugging neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the minute, no one!
