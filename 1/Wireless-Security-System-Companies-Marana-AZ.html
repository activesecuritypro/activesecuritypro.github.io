<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically innovative outdoor camera we have actually checked. It has a close-up tracking feature, which instantly zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even determine individuals you have actually identified (after a knowing period).
