<p>I have this camera attached to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk intending into my corridor. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without problem. The IR lights at night have the ability to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle.
