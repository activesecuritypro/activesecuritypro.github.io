Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing, thanks to irregular and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>You can have it monitored or unmonitored when it comes to the wired systems. You can even do a few of the monitoring yourself in certain circumstances.
