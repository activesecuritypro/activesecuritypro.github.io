<p>While every house owner stresses over burglaries, skepticism has actually surrounded home security systems due to their generally high costs, complex agreements with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often leading to false alarms. Innovation integration is one Vivint's strengths. The company's excellent mobile app has been extremely ranked by users on both Google Play and the App Shop.
