<p>If you do experience a home intrusion emergency, you can trigger the 80dB alarm. I am somewhat dissatisfied by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food processor whereas lots of other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB and even 105dB. Regardless of that, the alarm should suffice to scare away intruders most of the times. To hold and recoup expenses alarm companies liable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company should be certified, pay any registration or false alarm costs, and supply physical evidence like camera video or a damaged window to necessitate authorities response.</p>
