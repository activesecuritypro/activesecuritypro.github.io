<h3>Monitored Home Security in Illinois</h3>
<p>Like any product that connects to the web and utilizes wireless technology, smart home security systems are vulnerable to hacking, particularly systems that lack encryption.

It costs a lot, its rates isn't always transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to point out that the customer care experience varies widely depending upon the dealership you go with. </p>
