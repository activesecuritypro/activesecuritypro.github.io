<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is premium, if not especially innovative, so we're truly recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan choice. Sure, you get a lower rate if you go with a three-year contract, but since Nest needs you to pay 100% of your remaining contract if you cancel, it's a big commitment. So select what will be the better offer for you. Go with the contract and gain those savings if you understand you'll remain put for at least three years. But if you might upgrade to a new office with different security needs, contract-free is your best option.</p>
