Reliability has long been at the heart of the argument over hardwired versus wireless home security systems. It's a debate that's often skewed by aspects such as suspicion over the susceptibility of wireless systems, including interference from radio signals and problems that trigger false alarms.

<p>After evaluating dozens of wired and wireless alternatives, the best home security camera for the majority of people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be established both indoors and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have a contract, and its equipment pricing is very sensible, so it's not a total splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>

<p>But monitored systems likewise tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month cost for a set quantity of time, typically one to five years. No-contract systems, which enable you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than committing to a long-lasting arrangement, are becoming more common.
