<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal since the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers recognize that the economical consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
