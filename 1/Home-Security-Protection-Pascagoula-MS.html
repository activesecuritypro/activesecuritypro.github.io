<p>Your CCTV camera might make you feel physically more secure, however after reading this short article, it will sure make you feel practically susceptible.

<p>Video recording isn't a basic alternative on a lot of security systems. Property owners trying to find a system that offers video recording need to ensure the alternative is readily available rather than assume it is. Storing video is also an issue. Video files are large, which means a lot of area is needed. There are a handful of companies that offer complimentary video storage, but the video is sent to a cloud account and just kept for a couple of days. For longer access to video, expect to pay a regular monthly storage charge.</p>

<p>All of this will cost you, though: A single camera (with the hub) is $399, and extra cameras are $299 each.

And if you want to conserve 4K videos, it's an extra $1.99 per camera per month, on top of the monthly strategy, the latter of which is waived for the very first year.
