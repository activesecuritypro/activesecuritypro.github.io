<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We initially saw Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it rapidly ended up being a personnel (and family and friends) favorite. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send alerts, you can't manage it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we could point them at the exact same area and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather.

All of the cameras were linked to the very same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router indoors (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>
