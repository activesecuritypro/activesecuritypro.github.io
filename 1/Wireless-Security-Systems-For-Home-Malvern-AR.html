<p>Various types of CCTV cameras. Here's another impressive wireless security function-- the Motion Detector. These infrared devices are installed inside your home. The alarm sounds and you'll get an alert when they discover motion. Rest assured, if there's any motion or turmoil, you'll be the very first to know. The best motion detectors can compare individuals and family pets, and some even boast facial recognition technology.</p>
<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, generally described as shock sensors, are different in that they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Normally, the most extreme frequencies created are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
