<p>Another area where Arlo excels is client service. After long-term testing this camera considering that we first made it a pick in 2016, we discovered that our Arlo Q began projecting a pink tint, which appears to be an ongoing issue for some owners.

I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker.
