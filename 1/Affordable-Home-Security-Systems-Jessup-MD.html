<p>Unlike traditional burglar alarms, which have a control panel (typically positioned in the entryway hall) that is used to deactivate the alarm and equip and alert you if any sensing units have been activated, clever alarms are controlled from a mobile phone app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you've currently left home, and notifies you if any of the sensing units have been set off, instead of getting home to discover your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and possibly annoying your neighbours). Nevertheless, smart alarms do need a hub that allows the different parts to wirelessly connect. However for a lot of smart alarms this hub can be put throughout your home.</p>
<p>Installation of the wireless alarm can be a diy" project for those who are handy, however a professional installation is recommended if the homeowner is not familiar with wireless alarm systems, to make sure whatever is appropriately established.

<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video in the dark is a concern.</p>
