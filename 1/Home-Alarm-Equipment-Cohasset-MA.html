<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when clients understand that the affordable customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
<p>We tried each of the cameras in several locations around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we tested each camera utilizing an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) as well as an Android smartphone (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint offers a wide range of equipment and home automation products at a sensible rate, the one area where the company especially stands out is in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
