<p>Nevermind how fantastic the cameras are. The very first question you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your information to 3rd party companies? I have actually dumped my Nest Cams because they were purchased by Google. Something we all need to consider. Sirens. So your camera has actually identified trespassers or wild animals. Do you wish to scare them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will do the trick. Note that these sirens might break local noise control laws, so examine ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>
<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not especially groundbreaking, so we're actually recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan alternative. Sure, you get a lower price if you opt for a three-year contract, however because Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining agreement if you cancel, it's a big commitment. So pick what will be the better offer for you. Go with the contract and gain those cost savings if you understand you'll remain put for at least three years. But if you might update to a new office with various security needs, contract-free is your best bet.</p>
<p>So what takes place if something triggers your alarm but you remain in a conference with a supplier and you do not get the alert? Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed vacation and your spotty cell service suggests you don't get signaled until the next day? If your system equipment consists of an audible alarm, the sound might frighten prospective intruders-- if you're lucky. But the police will not come till you personally call them. </p>
