These people are $18 a month more affordable and stayed in business three decades so I'm comfy providing a try.

Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>In our viewpoint, Protect America's greatest drawback is its three-year minimum agreement. But there's a plus side: Once you enter the agreement, Protect America offers the vital home security equipment totally free without extra upfront costs. You're just responsible for the monthly monitoring charge and any optional upgrades. There's also a cost match guarantee.</p>
