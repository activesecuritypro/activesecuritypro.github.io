<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
