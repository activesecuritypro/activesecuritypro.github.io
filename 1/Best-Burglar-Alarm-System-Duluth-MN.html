<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were excellent in our screening-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video.

Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the alarm system.
