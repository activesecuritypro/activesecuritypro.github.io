<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
