<p>Wi-Fi cameras aren't simply for recording a burglar in the act, though. They're also useful for casual home monitoring.

<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and might even trigger incorrect alarms. Incorrect alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the police if they occur often enough. Another possible drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment need to be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more pricey than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually offset by the fact that there are no installation expenses.</p>
<p>We tried each of the cameras in several areas around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we evaluated each camera using an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) in addition to an Android smart device (using a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint offers a wide array of equipment and home automation products at an affordable cost, the one area where the company especially excels remains in DIY installation. </p>
