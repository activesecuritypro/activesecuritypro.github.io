<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously remarkable piece of technology.

It's far from the horrid metal CCTV box that you might recollect when you think of a home security camera. The first wireless function to think about is the security system and its parts, and how they all connect. In the past, every monitoring component was hard-wired back to a panel box. This meant every door and window needed its own wire and course of holes through your house.</p>
