<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it supplies protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to discover it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false sense of security given that it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
