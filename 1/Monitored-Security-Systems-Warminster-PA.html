With years of experience monitoring and installing video and audio security systems for Seattle homes and companies, we've developed fantastic relationships with both local police forces and their clients.</p>
<p>A system that requires an agreement might be a smart choice for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Due to the fact that contract-based security systems typically do not featured in advance charges. Rather, the costs are expanded over the length of the contract. We've seen 1-year, all the method as much as 5-year contracts!

For example, if you have pets that are over 30 pounds, you will need a security system whose motion sensors can be changed or a system that can be installed in such a method that your big animals will not trigger false alarms to be sent whenever your family pet moves. If you have large pets, you may want to think about avoiding the motion sensors and rely more on the doors and window sensing units which aren't triggered by motion however are set off when a window or door is opened.</p>
