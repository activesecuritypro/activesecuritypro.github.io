<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it offers protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to spot it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect complacency because it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
