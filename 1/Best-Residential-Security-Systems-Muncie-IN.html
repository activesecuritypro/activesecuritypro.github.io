Some small-business owners will likewise like Nest's contract-free plan option. Sure, you get a lower rate if you choose a three-year contract, however because Nest needs you to pay 100% of your staying contract if you cancel, it's a big dedication. So choose what will be the much better deal for you. If you know you'll stay put for at least three years, opt for the contract and reap those cost savings.

It also means that if you really saw a burglar riffle through your home, you might quickly tape a message to him or her through your mobile phone, and the Nest would play it aloud. Which, you imagine, would be enough to send out even the most committed career criminal scuttling empty-handed down the roadway. </p>
