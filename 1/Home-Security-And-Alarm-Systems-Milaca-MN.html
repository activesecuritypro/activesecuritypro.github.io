<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally typical given that the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when clients recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
