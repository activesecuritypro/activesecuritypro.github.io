<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal because the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers realize that the economical customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
