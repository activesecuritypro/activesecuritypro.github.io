<p>Unlike wired security systems, wireless systems allow for on-the-go" monitoring of your system from a cellular phone - anytime, anywhere. It is necessary to bear in mind that without professional alarm monitoring, Jacksonville cops aren't as most likely to react, unless an irritated next-door neighbor calls them to complain about the sound of the alarm that has actually been triggered.</p>
<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see in the evening. If catching video in the dark is a top priority, make sure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
