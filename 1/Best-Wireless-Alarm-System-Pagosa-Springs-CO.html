We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between people and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>

<p>The 2nd crucial thing to state is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a surprisingly ear-piercing built-in alarm, so it operates as a home alarm system as well as a security camera.
