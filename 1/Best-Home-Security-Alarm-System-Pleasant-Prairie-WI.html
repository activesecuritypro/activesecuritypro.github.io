<p>Several other models were disqualified due to performance issues. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise pestered with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (up to 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, typically buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of approximately 90 seconds in between videos.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical given that the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as clients realize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
