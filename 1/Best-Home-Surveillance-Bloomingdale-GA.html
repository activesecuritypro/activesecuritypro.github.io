<p>Wireless sensors protect all points of entry. Light, discreet & easy to position up to 200ft. from the panel. When a motion sensor detects motion in the room, it will automatically signal the control panel, triggering the alarm. Digital video recorders (DVR) are important to modern security camera systems, allowing for the recording of security footage from your CCTV security cameras, for playback when required.</p>
<p>Because it's more complicated than it needs to be, we do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, notifies, and combination all need separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing out on, thanks to irregular and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>I explained that all we would need to do is tap into any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, which camera would end up being the interface into the VMS system. When a patient pushes the emergency situation button, it sends out double notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Furthermore, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the risk and, if required, could merely push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>

<p>No matter the resolution, attempt to pick a camera with a fairly large field of view (seeing angle) and make sure it can record clear night vision video. Most cameras utilize IR (infrared) LEDs to deliver black-and-white night video, but there are a few out there that use white light to deliver full-color night video. Look for a camera with a night vision variety of at least 30 feet.</p>
