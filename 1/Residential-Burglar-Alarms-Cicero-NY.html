<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially discovered Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it quickly became a staff (and family and friends) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send informs, you can't manage it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
<p>The potential value of public surveillance technology was well demonstrated all the method back in April, 2013 when investigators recognized the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing after sorting through video images recorded by the city's cameras.
