<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal since the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers understand that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
