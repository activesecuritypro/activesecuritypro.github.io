<p>Seattle's primary intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more liable for false alarms, and reduce the variety of unnecessary cops and fire reactions. Alarm monitoring companies are the experts and must be teaching their consumers how to appropriately set and care for their alarm.

Another potential downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be replaced or charged frequently in order to keep the system working.
