<p>We have all heard that old saying, you get what you pay for". If you're looking for a robust DVR system that feels premium and records in 2K quality, this model from Samsung Wisenet will fit the costs. It ships with 4 white and sleek bullet-style cameras created for indoor and outdoor usage.

Like others on our list, the DVR system deals with a mobile app that lets you view what the cameras are seeing in real-time, though we discovered in our screening that the app occasionally forgot cameras which then needed to be re-added.</p>
<p>The greatest disadvantage of SmartThings is that there's no camera. As such, if an alarm or sensor gets set off while you're away, you have no visual methods of confirming if something is in fact incorrect and how major the scenario is. If the alarm event is determined to be a false alarm, the city will send by mail an invoice summarizing the incident and evaluating a charge, if any.</p>
