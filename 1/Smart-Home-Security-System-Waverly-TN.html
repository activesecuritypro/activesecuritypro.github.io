Wireless security systems are more integratable and agile, but low signal strength and bad connection are still common complaints. Hardwired systems require very little maintenance, and except a general power interruption, are harder to interrupt. Regardless of a basic improvement in wireless technology, there appear to be less methods for hardwired systems to be interfered with and paralyzed. </p>
