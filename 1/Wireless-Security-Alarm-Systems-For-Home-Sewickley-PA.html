They can be installed on the outside or interior of a building to monitor sensitive areas such as entrances, car park, cash spaces, or secure areas of a structure.

<p>However monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey monthly cost for a set amount of time, typically one to 5 years.
