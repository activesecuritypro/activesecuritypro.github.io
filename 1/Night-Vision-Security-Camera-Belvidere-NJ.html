<p>This awesome wise alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device.

It's likewise worth keeping in mind that it needs to be set up on the ceiling (it only keeps track of for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly. It also had the quietest alarm of all that we tested and there's no external monitoring service available.</p>
