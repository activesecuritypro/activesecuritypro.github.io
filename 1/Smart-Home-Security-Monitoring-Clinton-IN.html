This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, but not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for additional wiring.

Wireless security cameras may require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, generally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
