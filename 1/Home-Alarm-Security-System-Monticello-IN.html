For starters, it looks lovely: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if strangely similar to the AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey). When you think of a home security camera, it's far from the horrid metal CCTV box that you might call to mind.

<p>The first thing I look at in a security system are its system elements. Home security industry is attempting to provide new devices and innovation is evolving. Now, many security systems involve a great number of elements, such as a base station, security camera, glass, motion, and entry break sensing units, a keypad, and crucial fobs, to name a few parts.

Whatever the elements are (camera, motion sensor, window sensing unit, wise lock, and so on), I want to make certain that they all easily communicate with your app that is always at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>
