However, bear in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls must be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs confirmation from a private guard. A number of cities likewise need a permit to even own and operate a home security system. Rules such as these are designed to limit the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Lots of municipalities will fine you for a lot of false alarms.</p>

You can extend the amount of days you get by acquiring a membership, however I don't believe many people will require that option.</p>

Try to find an outdoor camera that will integrate with other smart home devices such as garage door openers, external sirens, and wise switches.</p>
