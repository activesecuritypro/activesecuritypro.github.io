In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls must be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs confirmation from a private guard. A number of cities likewise need a permit to even own and operate a home security system.

You can extend the amount of days you get by acquiring a membership, however I don't believe many people will require that option.</p>
