<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare people and general motion.
