<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents speaking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively typical. If a house owner forgets their keys and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is set off by an area cat, it can trigger the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>
