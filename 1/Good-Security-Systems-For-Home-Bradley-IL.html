<p>Nevermind how terrific the cameras are. The first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your data to third party companies? I've ditched my Nest Cams considering that they were bought by Google. Something we all need to think of. Sirens. So your camera has found trespassers or wild animals. Do you want to scare them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will do the trick. Note that these sirens may break local sound control laws, so check ahead of time prior to making the purchase.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as consumers understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
<p>When your camera are set up, you can pick whether your cameras will be monitored by the main station.

However, you may choose to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is generally done for cameras that are monitoring indoor, suburbs). Cameras that are not monitored by the central station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if requested by the customer. </p>
