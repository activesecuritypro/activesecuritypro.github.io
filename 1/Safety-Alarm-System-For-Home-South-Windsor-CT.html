<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>When your video cameras are installed, you can pick whether or not your cameras will be monitored by the main station. If you choose to have your cameras monitored (this is generally provided for cameras that are monitoring outdoor locations), then yes, central station operators will see the video that is taped when an alarm is activated. However, you may choose to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is typically provided for cameras that are monitoring indoor, suburbs). Cameras that are not monitored by the main station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if asked for by the customer. </p>
