<h3>Remote Home Security in New York</h3>
<p>Clear night vision is among the most important functions for outdoor security cameras.

The variety of infrared LEDs used in a camera figures out how far your outdoor security camera will have the ability to plainly reveal what's outside your home.

Lots of models also have an integrated IR cut-switch that instantly enables and disables the infrared technology depending upon the lighting conditions.</p>

<p>Also called eyeball" cameras, the turret camera has a ball-and-socket joint to let you exactly reroute the field of view without remounting the security camera each time. They're fantastic for storage facilities.

<p>Fixed-mount security cameras are non-discriminating in what they tape-record; everything within their focus capability is captured. That is to say, CCTV cameras are pretty un-focused when it concerns separating the images of an active event about to occur. However you can't buy this camera on its own-- you need to contribute to a complete Vivint home security system. </p>
