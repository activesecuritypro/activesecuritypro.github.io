<h3>Remote Home Security in New York</h3>
<p>Clear night vision is among the most important functions for outdoor security cameras.

The variety of infrared LEDs used in a camera figures out how far your outdoor security camera will have the ability to plainly reveal what's outside your home. Try to find surveillance cameras that have at least 100 feet or better of night vision. Lots of models also have an integrated IR cut-switch that instantly enables and disables the infrared technology depending upon the lighting conditions.</p>

<p>Also called eyeball" cameras, the turret camera has a ball-and-socket joint to let you exactly reroute the field of view without remounting the security camera each time. They're fantastic for storage facilities. Some of these might resemble dome cameras, but there's a basic trick to differentiate them - if the lens and the IR LEDs are in front of the glass on the housing instead of consisted of behind it, you have actually got a turret camera rather of a dome.</p>
<p>Fixed-mount security cameras are non-discriminating in what they tape-record; everything within their focus capability is captured. That is to say, CCTV cameras are pretty un-focused when it concerns separating the images of an active event about to occur. However you can't buy this camera on its own-- you need to contribute to a complete Vivint home security system. </p>
