<p>Throughout our screening, this compact camera recorded sharp, 1080p HD images day and night, and its digital zoom worked for taking a more detailed look. We particularly like this camera's large, 180-degree field of view, since you're less most likely to get a blind area any place you set it up. For less than $400, you get 2 door and window sensing units, one motion detector, and a video doorbell with two-way talk.</p>
