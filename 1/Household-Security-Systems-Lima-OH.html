<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against theft, vandalism, and scams. You get 1080p HD streaming, a 130-degree field of vision, the normal motion informs, and a 90+ dB alarm that is most likely to frighten any approaching burglar before they have actually got too far into your home. When you're at home and don't want to be tape-recorded, the privacy-conscious will be pleased to hear there's a physical shutter you can close over the camera.</p>
