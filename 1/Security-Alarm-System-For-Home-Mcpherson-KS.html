<p>Professional installation was almost the only method to put in a home security system 15 years earlier.

<p>This usually would enter a closet or utility room somewhere in the premises. It is used in older or bigger systems to connect the components. Usually you would find a PCB with many terminals or antennas for connections. Many also have integrated backup batteries for wired systems and a phone or ethernet line in or out port. Some might have a serial port for connection to a service technician's computer system for diagnostics. These are the real heart of the system.

In some cases, the interface does link directly to the parts or service, but in many cases it is passed on through a center or primary panel.</p>
<p>Wireless security cameras leverage your home or services WiFi connection to develop a surveillance network.
