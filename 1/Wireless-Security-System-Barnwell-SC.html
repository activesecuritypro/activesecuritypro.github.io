<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we could point them at the same spot and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather condition.

All of the cameras were linked to the same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router inside your home (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>
