If the camera identifies an admit it does not acknowledge, it will send a notification and image to your phone, enabling you to give that person the once over.

<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not especially revolutionary, so we're really suggesting the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will likewise like Nest's contract-free plan option. Sure, you get a lower rate if you choose a three-year contract, but since Nest requires you to pay 100% of your staying contract if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So choose what will be the much better offer for you. Go with the contract and enjoy those savings if you know you'll remain put for at least 3 years. However if you may update to a new office with different security needs, contract-free is your best option.</p>
