It's easy to set up and, thanks to its magnetic, rotating base, it can be installed practically anywhere inside. The video looks sharp; night vision is clear; the camera can be used as an intercom; and it engages with the Nest Thermostat and the Nest Protect smoke detector, as well as various third-party clever- home gadgets. But to actually use the camera's functions, you'll have to shell out $10 or more each month for the Nest Aware program, which gives you access to cloud storage, person detection and adjustable activity zones.</p>

There's a whole new wave of less-expensive Do It Yourself systems, cameras, smart locks, and video doorbells to think about alongside the professional alarm and monitoring system alternatives that have been around for years.

Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera spotted activity. Having the ability to distinguish between a person and a vehicle, for example, allows you to reduce unnecessary notifies. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, particularly if you're seeking to monitor a particular corner of the yard, a doorway, or perhaps garbage cans. </p>
