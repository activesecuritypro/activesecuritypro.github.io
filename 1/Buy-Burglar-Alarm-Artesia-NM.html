<p>When activated, alarm systems most commonly do seven main jobs. The first job is the alert of a siren, this allows for everyone in your community including the property owners or entrepreneur to understand that an intruder has actually been detected. The 2nd task is flashing outdoor lights. Not all burglar alarms have flashing outdoor lights however the most typical alarm system and some of the more advanced ones do. The most common type of burglar alarms possess a car dialer which alerts cops in the area to dispatch to the business or the home that is being burglarized.

It can distinguish between general motion and people, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even identify individuals you've labeled (after a learning period). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big quantity of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the need for more circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might need less circuitry in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera independently, generally via 110VAC power. </p>
