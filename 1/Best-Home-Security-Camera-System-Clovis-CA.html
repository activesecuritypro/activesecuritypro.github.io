<p>The Blink XT2 is small, works on 2 AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it records a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone notifications and live views were painfully sluggish, and the variety is poor.
