In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls should be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires verification from a personal security personnel. Several cities also require a permit to even own and run a home security system. Rules such as these are created to restrict the time and resources that authorities and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Numerous municipalities will fine you for a lot of false alarms.</p>
