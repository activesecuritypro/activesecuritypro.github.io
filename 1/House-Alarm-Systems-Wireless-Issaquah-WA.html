<p>This awesome wise alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. Throughout screening, we discovered it was easy to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly setting off when movement was detected. We love that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll need several Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get costly. It's also worth keeping in mind that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it just monitors for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly. It also had the quietest alarm of all that we checked and there's no external monitoring service offered.</p>
