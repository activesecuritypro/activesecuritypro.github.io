We first discovered Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it rapidly became a staff (and family and friends) fave. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker.
