<p>Nothing is more important than securing what you treasure most ... your household and home. You don't have to buy a multi-million dollar surveillance system to watch on your home and ownerships. On the occasion that your alarm system is triggered, your home security system sends a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security experts are standing by to react by instantly connecting with you and if need be, the local medical, fire or police authorities.</p>
<p>A system that requires a contract might be a clever choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Because contract-based security systems usually don't featured upfront charges. Rather, the expenses are expanded over the length of the agreement. We have actually seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting contract (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>
