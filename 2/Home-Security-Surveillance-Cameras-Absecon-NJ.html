<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens.

Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
