<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to detect it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false complacency because it avoids just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
