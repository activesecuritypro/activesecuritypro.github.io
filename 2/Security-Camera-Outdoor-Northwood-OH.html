<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially saw Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it rapidly ended up being a staff (and family and friends) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send out notifies, you can't control it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
<p>It works with a wire or without, with a Canary Smart base station or without, and can run inside your home or inside - you get a lot of flexibility from this little device.

That's simply $0.66 a day (or about $20 a month) for standard home security equipment and the peace of mind of professional monitoring.</p>
