<p>Seattle's primary intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more accountable for false alarms, and minimize the number of unnecessary cops and fire reactions. Alarm monitoring companies are the experts and ought to be teaching their consumers how to correctly care and set for their alarm.
