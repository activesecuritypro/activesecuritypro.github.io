<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
