So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no idea I was in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Really annoying. Once again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not point out the 3 year dedication. I called their client service team and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to discuss it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the swelling sum, because obviously they auto renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send in a written not by mail.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
