Cameras are pretty standard for self monitored alarm systems, especially since incorrect alarms is an extremely genuine possibility.</p>
<p>There's a few other cool functions in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving things if it identifies an intruder; an useful intercom function that allows the gadget to function as a smart doorbell (although it doesn't have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hi doorbell ); and, considering that Alphabet owns Nest, the camera carries Google Assistant.</p>

<p>A number of other models were disqualified due to efficiency concerns. We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise plagued with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (as much as 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, typically buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of as much as 90 seconds between videos.</p>
<p>We have actually published deals from Woot for Ring, Arlo, SimpliSafe and Zmodo wireless security systems. We've seen prices as low as $50, though a lot of have been around $120.
