<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see during the night. If capturing video footage in the dark is a priority, make sure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
