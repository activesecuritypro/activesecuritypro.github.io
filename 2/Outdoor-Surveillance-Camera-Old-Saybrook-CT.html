The one time where lag does become a bit of a problem is between identifying and recording movement.

<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect sense of security considering that it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
