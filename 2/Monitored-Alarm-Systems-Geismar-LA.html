<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big quantity of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reputable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for additional electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, normally through 110VAC power. </p>
