Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just an incorrect complacency since it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
