<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>The report, entitled Is your CCTV system secure from cyber attack?, says there are "major vulnerabilities" in both standard DVR-based CCTV systems, as well as cloud-based video systems. Hackers can "quickly" hijack connections to the device's IP address, putting a lot of individuals, their properties and information at danger. </p>
