<h3>Security Alarm System For Home in Decatur TN</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
