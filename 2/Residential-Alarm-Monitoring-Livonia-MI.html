<p>In The Sims 2, an alarm system will cover the entire space it is placed in. Burglar alarms can not be put outdoors, unless the moveobjects cheat is used. Each room with a door to the outdoors should have an alarm. If cheats are used to position an alarm system outdoors, it will cover the entire outside area, blocked only by outdoor fences.</p>
<p>What actually sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be costly but is vital. In reality, we don't suggest buying this camera at all unless you prepare to include the membership. Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera spotted activity. Being able to distinguish between an individual and an automobile, for example, permits you to minimize unneeded alerts. And Activity Zones are a good perk, particularly if you're looking to monitor a particular corner of the lawn, an entrance, or even garbage cans. </p>
