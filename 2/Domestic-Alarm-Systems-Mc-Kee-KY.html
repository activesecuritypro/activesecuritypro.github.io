<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive plan, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and functions are almost similar to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's strategies are somewhat more expensive for the exact same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation charges are burdensome, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyway.</p>
