<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had actually suffered a data breach, but we concur with its suggestion that users should reset passwords and allow two-factor authentication as a precautionary step. All smart-home devices are vulnerable to such incidents. However, after this most current entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have actually decided to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells.

While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video items, we do not think that these problems alter the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our existing suggestion.</p>
