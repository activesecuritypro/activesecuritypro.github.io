<h3>Video Security System in Odessa MO</h3>
<p>Customer care is typically ignored in a market like this where people don't think they're ever going to talk with their alarm company. We have first hand experience dealing with these companies (as clients ourselves) and firmly think that customer care is really essential.

<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it provides protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to discover it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false complacency since it avoids only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
