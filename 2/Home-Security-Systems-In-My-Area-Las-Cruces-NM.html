<p>While you need to pay for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it is among the more economical memberships out there at $2.99 a month. This is a pricey security camera, however we believe it's worth the investment.

Lots of sites needing alarm installations no longer have standard telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with standard telephone dialer ability do not work dependably over some types of VoIP service.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize individuals the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send out smartphone notifies with that information when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also supply a broader range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
