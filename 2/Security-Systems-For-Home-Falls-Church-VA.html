<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has actually clearly tried to offer it an appealing edge, and we have to provide credit to its ability to reveal what's going on from approximately 4 cameras at a time.

The previous, more affordable variation of the outdoor Nest web cam is still on sale too if you want to save some money - it does have a cable television attached however, instead of working wirelessly, which implies it's a bit much easier to screw up for prospective burglars.
