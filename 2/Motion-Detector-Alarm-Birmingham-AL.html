<p>Absolutely nothing is more important than securing what you treasure most ... your household and home. You do not have to purchase a multi-million dollar surveillance system to keep an eye on your property and possessions. In the event that your alarm system is triggered, your home security system sends a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security specialists are standing by to react by instantaneously contacting you and if need be, the local medical, fire or cops authorities.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively typical. If a property owner forgets their keys and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is triggered by an area feline, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the house owner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms occur.

Another potential downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can likewise be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is normally offset by the fact that there are no installation costs.</p>
