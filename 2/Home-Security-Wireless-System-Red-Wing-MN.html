<p>While every house owner stresses over break-ins, apprehension has surrounded home security systems due to their typically high costs, complex contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A security camera system is a whole video surveillance system linked together by a series of security cameras and network video recorders, providing trustworthy video monitoring around your home and business. 145 years ago, we invented security and alarm monitoring services. Today, we're reinventing the clever home. Firsts like Blue are what we do.

The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after nearly 2 years of day, night and use images have constantly been clear, and we never had issues with the camera missing motion, an issue we came across when checking the Wyze Cam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a clever feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It develops a green, on-screen box around the motion spotted. We've seen it highlight moths, cars and trucks, and mice.</p>
<p>Carbon monoxide detection. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that can be toxic to both animals and people. Since carbon monoxide is odor-free and colorless, the only method to monitor harmful levels of this gas is with a carbon monoxide gas detector. Thankfully, most wireless security systems include carbon monoxide gas alarms that sound off if the amount of CO in your home increases to an unsafe level. With a wireless system, you can also receive push notifications on your phone or tablet that let you understand there is a problem, even when you're not in the house.</p>
