<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
<p>We have examined numerous essential reasons that one need to think about commercial-grade cameras so far, however, we have simply skimmed the surface area of the topic. In today's network-connected world, a surveillance system is rarely a stand-alone system. It is worth knowing if your proposed camera system will integrate with other products. </p>
