<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal since the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as consumers recognize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
