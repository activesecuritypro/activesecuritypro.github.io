Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to overlook items that put in percentages of pressure on the wires.
