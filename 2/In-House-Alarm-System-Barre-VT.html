<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to disregard objects that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires.

<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing video in the dark is a concern.</p>
