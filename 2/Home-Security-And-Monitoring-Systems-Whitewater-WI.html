<p>Most importantly, it's difficult to hate the image coming out of this $20 camera.

The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after nearly two years of day, use and night images have actually constantly been clear, and we never ever had issues with the camera missing motion, an issue we experienced when testing the Wyze Camera Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a creative feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It develops a green, on-screen box around the motion detected.

<p>Think about it this way, if a good still-camera costs a minimum of two hundred and fifty dollars (US $), how can a more advanced camera be sold for the low cost of forty dollars? It just does not accumulate. To use such low prices, producers need to cut corners, and completion result is compromised performance. What good is a surveillance camera that just works ideally in ideal conditions like intense sunlight? Consumer-grade cameras can work well in certain situations such as nanny web cams or signing in on a pet, though when aiming to gather evidence of a criminal offense they frequently lose.</p>
