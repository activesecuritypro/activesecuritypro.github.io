<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk to an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near the NVR is definitely something to be thought about. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would cause an interruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is a great option for long variety situations where poles and trees are not present.</p>
