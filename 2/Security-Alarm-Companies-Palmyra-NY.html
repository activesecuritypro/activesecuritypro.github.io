Pro-installed systems typically cost more, use equipment comparable to that of Do It Yourself systems, included usually burdensome and long agreements, and typically depend on the very same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they offer little advantage. A good example is the Vivint system, which we've examined independently and do not suggest for most people.</p>
