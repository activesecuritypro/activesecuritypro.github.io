<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the very same spot and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had installed on the porch by a certified electrical contractor (who occurs to be my hubby). All of the cameras were connected to the exact same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router inside (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize individuals the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those individuals and will send out smart device informs with that details when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
