However, after practically two years of use, day and night images have actually always been clear, and we never ever had problems with the camera missing motion, a problem we experienced when evaluating the Wyze Camera Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a smart feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion discovered. We have actually seen it highlight mice, automobiles, and moths.</p>
