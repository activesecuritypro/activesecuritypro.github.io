The system can be established to communicate through network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
<p>The combination of digital video surveillance and gain access to control becomes part of the natural merging of security technologies. Centralizing security into a single interface uses extra information that may never ever have been possible before, such as notification of a staff member, by name and identification number, entering the building.

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing video footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
