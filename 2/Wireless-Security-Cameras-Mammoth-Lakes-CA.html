<p>For these different systems to converge or to incorporate them together into a single interface, a detailed knowledge of all the required systems is essential. There are only two options if there are no as-built documents providing functionality and setup info to make this combination work.

The other method is to rip and change, carrying out a complete upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to converge them all.</p>
