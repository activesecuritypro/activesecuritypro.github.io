<h3>Remote Home Security in Pennsylvania</h3>

The audio feed can be transferred using the very same wireless or wired network that sends the videos - hence improving system-wide implementation and circulation choices.</p>

<p>A number of other designs were disqualified due to performance issues. We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.
