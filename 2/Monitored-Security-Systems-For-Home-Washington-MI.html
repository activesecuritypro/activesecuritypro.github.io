<p>Mix of Man and Maker: People should be out on the work-places and streets trying to avoid criminal activity or losses. CCTV cameras are just a less efficient option to having authorities stroll the streets or security personnel on patrolling and physical surveillance. Just like any innovation, using cameras is by no suggests a replacement for good old-fashioned ground work. The camera video supplies extra leads in an investigation and help in protecting witness cooperation. The video footage works as a complement to - but not a replacement for - eyewitness proof in the courtroom.</p>

<p>Another benefit to monitored systems is if you buy a monitored security plan, the very same company that monitors the system will install it for you. If you're not mechanically inclined, having a professional set up the system might provide you more self-confidence than if you did the work yourself. Wireless cameras can't have all of it-- see things inside by day, and keep an eye on what's going on outside after dark. It hardly ever works.</p>
