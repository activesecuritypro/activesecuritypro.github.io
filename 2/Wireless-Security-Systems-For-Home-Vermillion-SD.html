<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technically innovative outdoor camera we have actually tested. It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and individuals, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even recognize individuals you have actually labeled (after a knowing duration).
