<p>Some wireless home security systems provide a video recording storage option and others do not. For the ones that don't, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home any time you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is taped. The systems with video storage usually include either a local storage or cloud storage alternative. A local storage alternative saves a pre-determined number of video clips on the gadget itself. This choice is usually cost-free. A cloud storage option saves your video in the cloud. Nevertheless, this is generally a paid service and the variety of hours it will keep will depend upon how much cloud storage you are willing to spend for.</p>

Nevertheless, you may choose to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is normally provided for cameras that are monitoring indoor, residential areas). Cameras that are not monitored by the main station can not be accessed our operators for any factor, even if requested by the customer. </p>
