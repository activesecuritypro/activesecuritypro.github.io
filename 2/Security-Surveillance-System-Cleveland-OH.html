<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
