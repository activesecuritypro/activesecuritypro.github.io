<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal considering that the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
