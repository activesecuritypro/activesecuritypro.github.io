<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine individuals the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those individuals and will send out smart device notifies with that information when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also offer a broader range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
