<p>One of the very best aspects of this alarm is that it has an exceptionally innovative motion sensing unit. Due to the fact that it utilizes infrared sensing units and mass detection to distinguish in between individuals and other inanimate things or smaller sized living things, it just gets triggered when a human comes in close distance. If your motion sensor is activated, you get an alert in your mobile phone app. There's no latency so you get alerted right away so you can take immediate actions such as activating a loud alarm, calling the authorities, or using the camera's two-way audio system to talk with the potential intruders.</p>

Due to the fact that the Pro 2 doesn't do constant video recording, it takes a 2nd for the camera to actually turn on when it finds motion. They could get past the camera prior to it had time to tape them if a wicked bad guy was quickly enough.</p>

Dome Cameras - vandal-proof and discrete cameras with a wider viewing angle, perfect for inside or outside your home. Plus, the camera does not have actually infrared night vision. It counts on the light to switch on and show you what's there, but we 'd at least like some infrared backup.</p>
