<p>Are privately owned, operated surveillance cameras to be dealt with the same way as public cameras? We also need to draw great lines about 'Who truly is enjoying you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Huge brother? The Corporates? Or pestering neighbour? Who fixes a limit in between public interest and harassment? At the minute, no one!

Regardless of a basic improvement in wireless innovation, there appear to be fewer ways for hardwired systems to be disrupted and incapacitated. </p>
