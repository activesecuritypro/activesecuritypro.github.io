<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most highly advanced outdoor camera we have actually checked. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare general motion and individuals, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even identify people you've identified (after a knowing period). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>Choosing which surveillance cameras will work best in a specific environment is most convenient when the advantages and drawbacks of each camera are known. When comparing camera types and prices, keep the following 3 consider mind. Cameras that record 4K (Ultra HD) video are also available, but you'll require a very strong network connection to stream it without experiencing choppiness or lag, and you'll require lots of room to shop recorded video, which may result in pricey cloud storage charges. </p>
