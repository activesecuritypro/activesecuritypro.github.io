<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously outstanding piece of technology. For beginners, it looks stunning: the all-white style and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily reminiscent of the AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey). It's far from the ghastly metal CCTV box that you might call to mind when you picture a home security camera. The first wireless function to consider is the security system and its parts, and how they all link. In the past, every monitoring part was hard-wired back to a panel box.

<p>Costs for systems differ. Bigger systems that use full-house coverage with expert monitoring are the most expensive alternatives. Smaller sized, self-monitored systems are the most cost effective choice. Remember that cameras with two-way audio usually work like walkie talkies.

And while this is a pretty basic function in indoor cameras, two-way audio is fairly unusual in outdoor security cameras.</p>
