<p>One essential exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 each month, which could be an affordable alternative for customers in backwoods.

<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by an expert home security company. When the system identifies a break-in, fire, or other emergency, it informs the security group and, in some cases, emergency responders. Unfortunately, history has shown that surveillance technologies put in place for one purpose undoubtedly expand into other uses.
