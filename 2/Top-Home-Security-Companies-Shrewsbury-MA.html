<p>For these separate systems to assemble or to incorporate them together into a single interface, a comprehensive knowledge of all the needed systems is required. If there are no as-built documents offering functionality and setup details to make this combination work, there are just two options. The very first option, which may be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original service provider is unavailable or unwilling to provide those information) and record the topology and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system. The other approach is to change and rip, performing a total upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to converge them all.</p>
<p>What to think about: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 monthly, but you'll pay a bit more if you wish to include extra functions, like a security camera.

Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed vacation and your spotty cell service suggests you don't get alerted till the next day? If your system equipment includes an audible alarm, the sound might frighten potential intruders-- if you're fortunate. However the police will not come until you personally call them. </p>
