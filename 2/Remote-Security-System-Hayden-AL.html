<h3>Top Home Security Companies in Alabama</h3>

<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, most burglar alarms work the precise same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electric present. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to unlock that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical present to stream throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
