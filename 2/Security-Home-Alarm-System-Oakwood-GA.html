A self-monitored system does not mean a homeowner has to sacrifice any features.

<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, many burglar alarms work the exact same method. They use open and closed circuits to move an electrical existing. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door enables the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
