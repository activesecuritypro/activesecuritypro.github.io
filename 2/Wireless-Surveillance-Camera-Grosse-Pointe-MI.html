<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video in dark conditions.

Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see during the night. If catching footage in the dark is a priority, ensure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
