<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false sense of security given that it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
