<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software to spot it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false sense of security given that it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular given that the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
