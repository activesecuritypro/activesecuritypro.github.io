If you're starting from scratch, we 'd probably advise a company like Vivint, ADT, or Frontpoint.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is a strong well-rounded camera that works inside or out, and it's extremely easy to install. The biggest downside is the investment. You need to purchase a base station in addition to two cameras, that makes the up-front cost more hefty than other cameras.
