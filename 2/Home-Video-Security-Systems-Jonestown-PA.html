<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the same spot and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had set up on the deck by a licensed electrical expert (who occurs to be my partner).

We also found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
