<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has clearly tried to give it an attractive edge, and we have to give credit to its ability to reveal what's going on from up to 4 cameras at a time.

All of the cameras were connected to the very same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router inside your home (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
