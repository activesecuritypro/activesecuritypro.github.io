<p>Nothing is more important than safeguarding what you treasure most ... your household and home. You don't need to buy a multi-million dollar surveillance system to watch on your home and possessions. In case your alarm system is triggered, your home security system sends out a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security specialists are standing by to respond by immediately getting in touch with you and if need be, the local medical, fire or police authorities.</p>
<p>When motion is found, nearly all outdoor security cameras are equipped with a motion sensing unit that will trigger the camera to tape video. The sensor can also initiate a push alert to your phone when activity is happening, and some will also create an email alert. For an extra layer of security, try to find a camera with sound detection that can let you understand if someone is out there even if they're out of range of the camera lens and the motion sensor. Fair caution: You'll most likely have to tweak the sound level of sensitivity settings to prevent informs from barking canines, loud vehicles, and other random sounds.</p>
