<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and general motion.
