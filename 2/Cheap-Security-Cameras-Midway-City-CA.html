<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to neglect objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to prevent this kind of attack.</p>

There are only two options if there are no as-built files offering functionality and setup details to make this integration work. The first option, which might be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial solution provider is not available or reluctant to provide those details) and record the topology and how they can be included into the new DVS system.

Operators at the station see the signal and take suitable action, such as contacting property owners, notifying authorities, or dispatching personal security forces. Such signals might be sent through dedicated alarm circuits, telephone lines, or the web.</p>
