When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>

After a while, the camera will find out to determine those people and will send smartphone alerts with that info when they appear at your home.
