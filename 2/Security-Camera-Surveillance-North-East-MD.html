<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
<p>So what occurs if something activates your alarm but you're in a meeting with a vendor and you don't get the alert? Or what if you've lastly gone on a much-needed getaway and your spotty cell service indicates you do not get informed till the next day? The noise may terrify off potential trespassers-- if you're fortunate if your system equipment includes an audible alarm. However the authorities won't come until you personally call them. </p>
