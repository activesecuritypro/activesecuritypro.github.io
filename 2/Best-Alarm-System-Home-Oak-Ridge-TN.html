Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge.
