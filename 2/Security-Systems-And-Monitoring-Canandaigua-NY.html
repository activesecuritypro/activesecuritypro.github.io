<p>A tight wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to ignore items that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
