<p>Nothing is more vital than protecting what you treasure most ... your household and home. You don't have to purchase a multi-million dollar surveillance system to keep an eye on your residential or commercial property and possessions. In the event that your alarm system is triggered, your home security system sends out a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security professionals are standing by to respond by instantly getting in touch with you and if need be, the regional medical, fire or police authorities.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents consulting with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly typical. If a property owner forgets their keys and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is set off by an area feline, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the house owner will be contacted by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it rapidly. False alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a property owner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>

<p>Unlike standard alarm systems, which have a control board (usually positioned in the entryway hall) that is used to deactivate the alarm and equip and alert you if any sensors have actually been set off, smart alarms are managed from a mobile phone app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you have actually currently left home, and informs you if any of the sensors have been set off, instead of getting home to find your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and potentially frustrating your neighbours).
