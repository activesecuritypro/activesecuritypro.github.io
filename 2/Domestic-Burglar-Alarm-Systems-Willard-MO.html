<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to discover any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to overlook things that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
