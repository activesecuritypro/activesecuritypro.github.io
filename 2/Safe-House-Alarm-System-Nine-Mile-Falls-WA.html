<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally regular because the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level.
