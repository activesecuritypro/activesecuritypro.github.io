<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false sense of security given that it prevents only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
