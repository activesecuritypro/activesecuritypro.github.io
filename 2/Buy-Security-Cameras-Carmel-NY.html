<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, most alarm systems work the precise same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical present to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the alarm system will trigger.</p>
