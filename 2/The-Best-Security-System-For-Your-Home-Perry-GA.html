<p>While some parts may be affected temporarily by a power interruption, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electrical power. Cellular systems use cell towers to interact with the monitoring center along with a battery backup that can keep them up and running for a number of hours till the electrical service is brought back. Landline systems utilize conventional phone lines to communicate with the monitoring center and, much like cellular systems, they normally have a battery backup to keep them working for a set period of time.</p>
<p>Piza and colleagues (2019) conducted a new review of the literature to upgrade a meta-analysis by Welsh and Farrington (2008) that took a look at the results of closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance on criminal activity avoidance.

Strategies consisted of searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV assessment research study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV evaluations, and contacting leading researchers to ask about forthcoming assessments. Both published and unpublished reports were included in the search, which was not restricted to the English language and was global in scope.</p>

<p>Camera compatibility: Not every video recorder can deal with every camera. Of course, DVRs need analog cameras, while NVRs use IP cameras, but the compatibility question extends well beyond that difference.

When buying a video recorder, you need to initially make sure that the device will work with the cameras you have actually purchased. The cameras need to be able to provide you with the required info if you're working with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system.</p>
