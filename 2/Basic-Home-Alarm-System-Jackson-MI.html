The Arlo Ultra doesn't come with a free tier of cloud storage, so you have to invest at least $3 per month if you want to save any videos. And if you want to save 4K videos, it's an additional $1.99 per camera per month, on top of the regular monthly plan, the latter of which is waived for the very first year.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing.

Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.
