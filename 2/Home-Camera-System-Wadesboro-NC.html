Some alarm systems serve a single function of burglary protection; mix systems offer both fire and intrusion protection. Intrusion alarm systems may also be combined with closed-circuit tv surveillance (CCTV) systems to automatically record the activities of burglars, and might interface to access control systems for electrically locked doors. Systems range from small, self-contained noisemakers, to complicated, multirally systems with computer system monitoring and control.
