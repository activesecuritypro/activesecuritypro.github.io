<p>On the surface, these 2 camera classifications might appear similar, though if you had the ability to see within, the distinctions end up being unique and obvious. Commercial-grade cameras are designed and constructed for high-performance applications where failure is not an alternative; consumer-grade cameras are not. Generally, consumer-grade cameras are constructed to work well when there is plenty of readily available light, and once the lighting becomes low or absent (think sunset or nighttime), their pedigree begins to reveal.
