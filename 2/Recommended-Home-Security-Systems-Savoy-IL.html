With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms take place. With a self-monitored system, a property owner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>
