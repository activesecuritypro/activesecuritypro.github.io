<p>While Scout's usually easy on the wallet, it does have one big stopping working: it charges extra for self-monitoring. Systems like Nest Secure, Residence, and Ring Alarm will all let you self-monitor your system for free. But Scout makes you pay a $10 monthly membership fee. Wamp wamp. In today age, use of security cameras has become inevitable at houses, shopping malls, roads, workplaces etc</p>
<p>Scout Alarm ties with Ring for the most cost-efficient monitoring strategy beginning at $10. You can get all the basics like push, sms, and e-mail informs, as well as 4G LTE cellular backup and battery for Scout's most inexpensive, Constantly On" strategy. However, you will need to pay for extra $2.99 cloud camera storage (per camera) per month, and this does not come with professional monitoring. This additional cost isn't ideal, however when compared to the Frontpoint and Vivint $40-and $45- respective minimum prices each month for monitoring, Scout Alarm is a take. </p>
