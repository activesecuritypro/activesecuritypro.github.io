<p>While you need to pay for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it's one of the more cost effective subscriptions out there at $2.99 a month.

Numerous sites requiring alarm setups no longer have conventional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with traditional telephone dialer ability do not work reliably over some types of VoIP service.</p>
