We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare people and general motion.
