<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to discover any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to disregard objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>

However, there were some problems with linking the command center to our tester's network. </p>
