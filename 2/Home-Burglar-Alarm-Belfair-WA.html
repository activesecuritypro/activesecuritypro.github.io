The large face of the camera offers you an excellent field of view, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the better it gets, the more data you'll use to save it to the cloud.)

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely regular given that the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers understand that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
