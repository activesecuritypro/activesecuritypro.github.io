<p>Another important topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand how much is enough. In this article, the term resolution" describes the variety of dots (pixels) that make up a video photo; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The exact same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about four times as much photo information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some challenging effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>

We also discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also supply a broader range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
