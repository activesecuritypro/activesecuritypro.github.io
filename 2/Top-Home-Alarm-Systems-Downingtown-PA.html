The exact same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about four times as much photo information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no.
