<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect complacency because it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
