<p>What truly sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be pricey but is necessary.

Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera found activity. Having the ability to distinguish between a vehicle and a person, for example, allows you to reduce unnecessary signals. And Activity Zones are a great perk, specifically if you're looking to monitor a particular corner of the backyard, an entrance, and even trash bin. </p>
