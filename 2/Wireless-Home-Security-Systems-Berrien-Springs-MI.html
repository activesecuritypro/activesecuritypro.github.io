<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated space.

Having the ability to distinguish between a vehicle and an individual, for example, allows you to minimize unnecessary signals. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, especially if you're seeking to monitor a particular corner of the lawn, an entrance, and even trash bin. </p>
