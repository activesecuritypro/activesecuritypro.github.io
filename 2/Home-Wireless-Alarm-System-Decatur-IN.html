<p>We have all heard that old stating, you get what you pay for". If you're looking for a robust DVR system that feels premium and records in 2K quality, this design from Samsung Wisenet will fit the expense. It ships with four streamlined and white bullet-style cameras created for indoor and outdoor use. They're geared up with night vision tech that uses infrared LEDs and smart IR to provide up to130ft (or 40m) night vision variety. Like others on our list, the DVR system works with a mobile app that lets you see what the cameras are seeing in real-time, though we found in our screening that the app occasionally forgot cameras which then needed to be re-added.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking to someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly common. If a property owner forgets their secrets and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is activated by an area cat, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a property owner won't receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the essential action.</p>
