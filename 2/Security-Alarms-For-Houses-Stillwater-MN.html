<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>Signals: Home security cameras press notifications to your smart device when they spot occasions. Without seeing the live feed all the time, this is the only way to keep tabs on your home in relative real time. Depending on the camera, it may send out text alerts when it detects motion, noise, a face (unacknowledged or known), or all three. Some can send signals to multiple individuals, usually anybody else in the household using that item's app; others will send out e-mails in addition to text messages as a failsafe in the event you can't access your mobile phone. </p>
