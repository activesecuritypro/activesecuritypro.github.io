<p>Establishing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or house is the duty of the whole neighborhood. The equipment required for the wired system tends to be a bit more affordable than the wireless systems.

<p>The wireless network wants all restricted to a small geographical location. A computer system connected to the Internet and having inappropriate setups or other security problems can be made use of by anybody from anywhere in the world, while just customers in a small geographical range can exploit an open wireless gain access to point.
