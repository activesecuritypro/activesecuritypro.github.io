<p>Up until now so normal. Things begin to get really fascinating with the Nest's facial acknowledgment system. If the camera detects a face it does not recognise, it will send an alert and photo to your phone, enabling you to give that individual the twice.

<p>So what happens if something activates your alarm but you're in a meeting with a vendor and you don't get the alert? Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed holiday and your spotty cell service suggests you don't get signaled until the next day?
