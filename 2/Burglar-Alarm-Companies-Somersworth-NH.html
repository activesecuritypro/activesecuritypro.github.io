<p>b. A bona fide effort has actually been made to fix any flaw and recognize of design, installation or operation of the alarm system system which was determined as the cause of the incorrect burglar alarm.

<p>You can set off the 80dB alarm if you do encounter a home intrusion emergency situation. I am somewhat disappointed by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food processor whereas lots of other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB. Regardless of that, the alarm needs to be enough to frighten burglars in most cases. To recover expenses and hold alarm companies responsible for incorrect alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company must be accredited, pay any registration or false alarm fees, and provide physical proof like camera footage or a damaged window to require police action.</p>
