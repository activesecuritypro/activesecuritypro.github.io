<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are practically identical to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's plans are somewhat more expensive for the exact same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation fees are difficult, and its prices is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyway.</p>
<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, indicating that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and could even trigger incorrect alarms. Incorrect alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the authorities if they take place often enough. Another potential downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be changed or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can likewise be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is typically offset by the fact that there are no installation costs.</p>
<p>The self-monitored strategy offers no monitoring support, meaning tripped alarms make noise but will not get in touch with local emergency situation services.
