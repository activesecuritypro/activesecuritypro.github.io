<p>In addition to the system itself, security alarms are typically coupled with a monitoring service. In case of an alarm, the premises control system contacts a main monitoring station. Operators at the station see the signal and take proper action, such as getting in touch with homeowner, informing police, or dispatching private security forces.

Their detectors utilize infrared innovation, so its harder for a pet or cat to trip the sensor. Vivint's sensing units are immune to family pets weighing up to 33 to 55 pounds. Frontpoint's detectors are unsusceptible to family pets weighing approximately 40 pounds. With ADT, the professional installer can personalize the level of sensitivity level based upon your family pet's size. </p>
