<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it provides protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect complacency considering that it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
