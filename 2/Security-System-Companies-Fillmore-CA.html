We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
