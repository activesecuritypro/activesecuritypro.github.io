<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are three times more likely to be robbed.

<p>A system that needs a contract may be a smart choice for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to spend for the equipment up-front. Why? Because contract-based security systems normally don't come with in advance fees. Rather, the expenses are expanded over the length of the agreement. We have actually seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you don't want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting agreement (and who does?). Our pick: No agreement.</p>

<p>Consumers can choose among 3 bundle tiers, each of which offers a different set-up of features, from basic monitoring with the Protection package to live video streaming with the Ultimate plan. We suggest either going with the Ultimate bundle, or buying a standalone security camera to supplement-- our tester found the video element to be essential for home security.</p>
<p>Not only do the Arlo Ultra's 4K cameras provide the very best home security camera video, but it also utilizes that extra resolution to make it possible for digital track and zoom, which makes it simpler to follow and ID an individual as they move across the frame.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>

Sometimes there is an installation charge.</p>
