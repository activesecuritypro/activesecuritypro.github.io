<p>One essential exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 monthly, which might be a budget friendly choice for customers in rural areas.

If you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still far better than no security at all.</p>

It costs a lot, its prices isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to point out that the customer service experience differs commonly depending on the dealership you choose. </p>
