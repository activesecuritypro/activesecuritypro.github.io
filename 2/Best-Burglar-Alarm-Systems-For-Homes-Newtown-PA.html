Also, if the camera is in the middle of recording, do not anticipate to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular considering that the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers recognize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
